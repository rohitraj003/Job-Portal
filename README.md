# JobPortal
## Overview 
JobPortal is an online platform designed to bridge the gap between students seeking job opportunities and recruiters looking to hire talent. The platform caters to two primary user groups: students who are actively searching for jobs and recruiters who have job openings in their organizations.The platform enables students to register, create profiles, and apply for job openings. Recruiters can register their companies and post job openings with specific requirements. The website features JWT-based authentication and uses MongoDB as the database for storing both student and recruiter information.
